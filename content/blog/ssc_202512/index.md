I was at the [Singapore Scientific Conference](https://singaporesciconf.org/overview/) last week, held in commemoration of SG60, organised by A*STAR and supported by the National Research Foundation. Over three days, eminent speakers discussed research and development advances in Sustainable Health, Environment, Manufacturing and Energy that have contributed to our economy and society.

Besides hard science and data, the programme included an 'SG Insights and Dialogues' category that featured panel discussions and dialogues.

This post is on "Mentorship as a Catalyst for Scientific Excellence"—my favourite session of the conference! Speakers opened up about how they benefitted from mentorship, and how they paid it forward by finding a way and making time to mentor in their day to day, while wearing many other hats.

The panel consisted of **Xiaodong Chen** (NTU), **Xinyi Su** (A*STAR IMCB), **Evelyn Wang** (MIT), and **Milena Corredig** (Aarhus University), with **Shi Yan Ng** (A*STAR IMCB) serving as session chair.

The moderator really only had to nudge the ball with a finger to get it rolling: barely was she over with her first prepared question, that the screen was filled up with audience questions via Pigeonhole Live. Obviously, this was a topic close to many hearts.

The panellists' responses to these questions could be distilled into three core questions that form the structure of this post:

1. Who is a mentor?
2. What does mentorship look like (i.e., what actions is it associated with)?
3. How do we practically embed mentorship into our daily activities?

This was a rich discussion which helped me think more broadly about mentorship—recognising that it can take on many forms outside the bounds of a structured program. I started understanding the definition and goals of mentorship, realising there were more mentors in my life beyond those I had previously considered, and recognising the many means they used to channel something of value to me.

I walked out of the session believing (again) that I am not too early in my career to be a mentor.

### **Who is a mentor?**

At the core, a mentor seeks out a person's best interests and sees their potential. This desire and perspective compels them to always be finding ways to impart value to and open doors for those they guide.

For Dr Evelyn Wang, who is Professor of Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), her scientific mentor saw how her fundamental skills could contribute toward promising scientific endeavours—lifting her beyond the narrow niche she was drilling down in early career and positioning her into what became a "defining new era" in her field.

Mentors are people who "put their names on the line" for us. Scientific mentors do this by inviting mentees onto important grants or proposals, or by passing along opportunities—speaking engagements, collaborations—that they believe would benefit their mentees.

As the panellists shared these qualities, names and faces flooded my mind. Starting with my reporting officer. She's done all of the above, but most importantly, she's walked me through failure. Her tireless forward focus, her knack for finding a way out, has built a safety net that's given me the courage to make one leap of faith after another, towards better.

Once, right after our first paper together was accepted for publication—after it had passed final peer review—I discovered a coding error early in the pipeline that would ripple through our key findings. What terrible timing, I thought. But she reframed it, pointing out it would be worse to catch it later. She never blamed me; just patiently, steadily helped me forge a path forward. I learned how to communicate the error and its implications clearly and fairly, which the reviewers received graciously.

Good mentorship can happen at any level. When I was a final-year PhD student, a colleague—just a year older and two years into his postdoc—pulled me onto a grant application. He has always championed my graphic-making ability, and he entrusted me with key figures for the proposal. "I hope we get it" he'd say, even though he was the main applicant. He has this remarkable ability to open doors for me to be part of something next-level, yet still feels second-nature.

Perhaps these stories stirred up your own memories of good mentorship. Recognise them, savour them, then become that person for someone else. If we only desire to pay it forward, we'll be able to find a way.

### **Embedding mentoring into everyday**

Mentorship takes time and thought—there are no shortcuts to making an impact whether mentoring happens within a structured programme or is more freeform.

Institutions are important enablers of this. Some incorporate mentoring in appraisals; relating to this, Prof Evelyn Wang pointed out non-overlap between mentors and evaluators as conducive for progress. At A*STAR IMCB, Prof Su Xinyi works on fostering a culture where mentorship happens at every level, or "bespoke mentorship." This is about peers finding and meeting each other's needs. IMCB facilitates this by organising sessions for peers to come together and brainstorm solutions to problems pertinent in their context. Some IMCB postdocs have shared that this has made them more "energized" about their careers.

Mentors wear many hats: some cannot carve out chunks of time for a structured programme, but still find ways to impart in a way that best fits into their day.

This can look like passing along opportunities that come your way to someone who will benefit from them—for example, letting a more junior colleague deliver a talk that you've been invited to give. Or it might mean thoughtfully assigning (or delegating) someone a task that you know will move the needle in their career: not just something where you need their help, but work that builds the specific capabilities that will get them to where they want and need to be.

Some forms of mentorship are even more camouflaged into our everyday—we may not even recognise these until long after we've benefitted.

Executive coach Yan Ping Chua articulates this well in her [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7404314848748011521/). Reflecting on her 18-year career in investment banking, she describes how an unlikely mentor—not someone formally assigned to her, helped salvage a career that nearly ended within the first five years.

She writes about her mentor:

> There was someone in the business - not my boss, not HR - but someone who also sat in the front office and worked closely with my team.
>
> Someone who understood my world:
>
> The immense revenue pressure.
> The intensity of the environment.
> The quiet politics you navigate without talking about it.
> The fear of failing in front of people who matter.
>
> Those informal conversations over coffee?
>
> That was coaching - the most effective kind.
> It landed because the context was shared.

Helping someone else level-up always requires intention and sacrifice. But imagine the exponential rewards of mentoring well—the time and resources saved when we pause to pour out our lived experience to shorten the road for a peer. Imagine how far we can see and go when everyone stands on each others' shoulders. As Dr Su puts it:

"Everyone thriving is a great group"

### **The real ROI of mentorship**

Most people wanted to know, "how can institutions create a culture where mentorship is valued as much as publications and grants?"

Ah, the perennial dichotomy between investing in people, and having something to show for it.

The panellists urged the audience not to see these results and mentorship as dichotomous. Publications and grants are visible metrics of value added to the scientific community—they are the fruit of the tenacious, meticulous thinkers and contributors that sound scientific mentorship nurtures us to become. A good mentor sets us up to meet targets that matter in our careers. In science, that's inseparable from publications.

The gains from mentorship may not be immediate. But from the panellists' passionate sharing, there is deep value and untold fulfilment in consistently showing up as a mentor, reflecting on our approach, and refining our craft.

So this 2026, I want to be more intentional about mentorship. And to help me along, I've reverse engineered these questions from the panelists's insights to craft my own blueprint:

**Questions to guide my mentorship practice:**

1. What forms of effective mentorship have I received?
2. Describe a time when I felt fulfilled by mentoring someone
3. What is one skill that I have mastered enough to impart to someone else—and how will I carve out time for that?

Looks like I've just sketched out my next three blogposts. Stay tuned ✌🏻
